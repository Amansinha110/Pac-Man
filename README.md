<h1>Aman Kumar: Building the Classic Pac-Man Game Using Python</h1>

<p>Aman Kumar, a dedicated software developer, successfully built a Pac-Man game using Python, demonstrating his expertise in programming and game development. Inspired by the iconic arcade game, he leveraged the guidance of Harshith YT Coding Channel to bring his project to life, implementing game mechanics with precision and creativity.</p>

<h1>Project Inspiration and Vision</h1>

<p>Pac-Man, originally released in 1980, remains one of the most beloved video games worldwide. Aman set out to recreate this classic, maintaining its nostalgic appeal while integrating modern programming techniques. His goal was to develop a seamless and engaging experience where players navigate Pac-Man through a maze, collect pellets, and evade ghosts.</p>

<h3>Development Process and Technologies Used</h3>

<p>I am chose Python as the primary language for development due to its versatility and ease of use. The Pygame library played a crucial role in handling graphics, animations, and user interactions.</p>

<h4>Key Features Implemented:</h4>

<p>Pac-Man Movement: Smooth player control and responsiveness using keyboard input.

Maze Generation: A structured grid-based maze where Pac-Man navigates and collects points.

Ghost AI: Implementing enemy movement patterns to challenge the player.

Collision Detection: Ensuring Pac-Man interacts correctly with walls, pellets, and enemies.

Score System: Keeping track of points earned by consuming pellets and power-ups.</p>

<h2> Challenges and Learning Experience</h2>

<p> During development, Aman faced challenges such as optimizing ghost AI behavior, handling smooth player movement, and maintaining performance efficiency. By referring to Harshith YT Coding Channel, he overcame debugging issues and refined his coding approach.

This project significantly enhanced Amanâ€™s knowledge of Python programming, logic-based game mechanics, and creative problem-solving. His ability to design interactive experiences became a highlight of his journey.</p>

<h3>Sample Code: Basic Pac-Man Game in Python using Pygame</h3>

```javascript
import pygame

# Initialize pygame
pygame.init()

# Set up display
WIDTH, HEIGHT = 600, 600
win = pygame.display.set_mode((WIDTH, HEIGHT))
pygame.display.set_caption("Pac-Man Game")

# Load assets
pacman_img = pygame.image.load("pacman.png")
pacman_x, pacman_y = 300, 300
speed = 5

# Main game loop
running = True
while running:
    pygame.time.delay(50)  # Control game speed

    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False

    # Get key presses
    keys = pygame.key.get_pressed()
    if keys[pygame.K_LEFT]:
        pacman_x -= speed
    if keys[pygame.K_RIGHT]:
        pacman_x += speed
    if keys[pygame.K_UP]:
        pacman_y -= speed
    if keys[pygame.K_DOWN]:
        pacman_y += speed

    # Clear screen and redraw
    win.fill((0, 0, 0))
    win.blit(pacman_img, (pacman_x, pacman_y))
    pygame.display.update()

pygame.quit()
```

<h1>Homework:</h1>

<p>You can continue working on this project if you like. You can design your own map by modifying the tileMap if you want. You can add power pellets to allow pacman to eat the ghosts. In addition, there is an opening on left and right, where if pacman goes through, it would appear on the other side of the map. Currently pacman just moves off screen out of the map so a fix would be needed to make pacman appear the other side. For more of a challenge, you can modify the ghosts movement to cover areas unreachable since the ghosts only change directions when they collide against a wall, and not when theres another path available to go through.</p>
